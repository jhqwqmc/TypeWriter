/**
 * The `Detect Command Ran Event` event is triggered when an **already existing** command is ran.
 *
 * :::caution
 * This event only works if the command already exists. If you are trying to make a new command that does not exist already, use the [`Run Command Event`](on_run_command) instead.
 * :::
 *
 * ## How could this be used?
 *
 * This event could be used to trigger a response when a specific command has been run.
 * For example, you could have a command that sends a message to a channel when a command has been run,
 * which could be used as an audit log for your admins.
